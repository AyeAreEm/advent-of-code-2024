# Advent of Code 2024
My solutions for advent of code this year but using a random language for each problem (unless i can't do it in said language ðŸ˜­)

## Day01
- Language: JS/TS (deno)

## Day02
- Language: Zig

## Day03
Solved part 1 myself but couldn't solve part 2. Had spent too much time on it at that point so I used @bornsurvivor88 on reddit's solution (thank you)
- Language: Rust
